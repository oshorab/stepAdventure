<h1>Step Adventure App</h1>
<p>
Step Adventure is a mobile app that allows users to play a text adventure
game while encouraging overall health. In order to progress the story, users
have to accumulate steps from walking or running. A user is presented with  
multiple decisions to choose from at countless points in the story with each 
decision costing a certain number of tokens. These tokens are obtained from
the amount of steps the user walks.

This app is built in React Native using JavaScript, allowing it to be 
cross-platform compatible. In-device pedometer data is used to keep track 
of a userâ€™s daily step count, and Async Storage is utilized to store game 
progress data locally.

The story is represented by a directed graph which consists of nodes that 
contain pieces of story content and decisions. This graph is generated by 
a story engine that was built to convert a JSON file containing story 
nodes, into a organized mapping of each possible path a user can follow.
